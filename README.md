# DeliveryTruck
This python code simulates the generation of a delivery route for a delivery company, provided with a set of packages and a map of the area, in the form of two properly formatted Excel sheets.

In Windows, assuming that you have Python installed, which can be found at Python.org, this code can be run by navigating through the command line to the folder containing all of the .py files, and executing the command "python Main.py".

This code could also be opened in a Python IDE, such as PyCharm, to look through and run the code.
